# Understanding `any`, `unknown`, and `never` in TypeScript

TypeScript enhances JavaScript by adding static typing, helping developers catch errors early. Among its powerful features are three special types: `any`, `unknown`, and `never`. Each serves a unique purpose, and understanding their differences is key to writing safer, more maintainable code.

---

## 1. The `any` Type: Escape Hatch with Risks

The `any` type is the most flexible in TypeScript—it disables type checking, allowing a variable to hold any value and bypassing compile-time errors.

```typescript
let dynamicValue: any = "Hello";
dynamicValue = 42;          // ✅ No error  
dynamicValue = true;        // ✅ No error  
dynamicValue();             // ✅ No error—but risky at runtime!
```

**🔍 Why Avoid `any`?**

* **No type safety:** Methods and properties can be accessed without checks.
* **Hidden bugs:** Errors surface only at runtime.

**✅ Use Case:** Rarely, during gradual migrations or when interacting with untyped libraries.

---

## 2. The `unknown` Type: Type-Safe Alternative

Introduced in TypeScript 3.0, `unknown` is like `any` but enforces type safety. You can assign any value to it, but you must validate its type before use.

```typescript
let userInput: unknown = "Hello TypeScript";

// ❌ Error: Object is of type 'unknown'
// console.log(userInput.toUpperCase());

if (typeof userInput === "string") {
  console.log(userInput.toUpperCase());  // ✅ Safe after type check
}
```

**✅ Why Use `unknown`?**

* **Forces type checks:** Prevents accidental operations on unverified types.
* **Safer than `any`:** Retains TypeScript’s safety guarantees.

**Ideal for:** Parsing external data (e.g., API responses) where types are uncertain.

## 3. The `never` Type: For Impossible Cases

The `never` type represents values that should never occur. It’s used in two scenarios:

### Example 1: Functions That Never Return

```typescript
function crash(): never {
  throw new Error("Something went wrong");
}

function loopForever(): never {
  while (true) {} // Infinite loop
}
```

### Example 2: Exhaustive Type Checks

```typescript
type Color = "red" | "blue";

function getColorName(color: Color) {
  switch (color) {
    case "red": return "Red";
    case "blue": return "Blue";
    default:
      const neverHappens: never = color; // 🚨 Error if Color is extended
  }
}
```

**🔍 Key Use Cases:**

* Functions that throw or loop infinitely.
* Ensuring all possible types are handled in a switch or conditional.

## 🔍 Quick Comparison

| Type      | Can Hold Any Value? | Type-Safe? | Common Use Case                           |
| --------- | ------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `any`     | ✅                   | ❌          | Avoid—bypasses type safety                |
| `unknown` | ✅                   | ✅          | Flexible input with mandatory type checks |
| `never`   | ❌                   | ✅          | Impossible cases or unreachable code      |

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

* Prefer `unknown` over `any` for safer dynamic typing.
* Use `never` to enforce exhaustive checks and document unreachable code.
* Avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary.

By leveraging these types intentionally, you’ll write more robust and maintainable TypeScript code. 🚀
